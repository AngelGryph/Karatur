@3    = ~Traveled far have we three ... many moons seen we have, across vast seas traveled far and long have we. Many a treasure collected, to sell our only wish ... to the port Baldur's we seek. Two moons ago trouble did come, sailing close to shore ... warned many times I did, much too close to shore said I ... songs of love and lingering ... in the souls of sailors strong, did happen a lust unnatural it was. Wake I did to trouble and dismay ... the ship is no wagon of land you see, and to shore the ship sailed, damaged greatly I fear ... chilled and bitter the water it was. Beauty and charm was upon all of our crew, friends now enemies all but we three. Forces greater than we could oppose, to this place flee we did, to rest ... and help we now seek. Help the three from Kara-Tur may thee?~

Frustrated the enemies will be, as no treasure exist but this Bag of Red. By fight or by stealth, perhaps parlay ... whatever may be, bring this Bag of Red to me, treasures of places far and wide, sell to you fair you'll see.

Ran we did fast and far, long it was not ago ... two moons for me ... where it is still remember I do. Travel to the south ... then west you'll go, to the shore and sandy coast. Ship you will see, abandoned with haste, guarded presumed by the crew of we three, as still the songs linger dost believes me. Bag of Red you will find, if look hard and long you will try. Return to me as quick you can, Bag of Red you bring to me.

Bag of Red indeed has weight, lift cannot a giant with strength, need my crystal for the bag to carry ... give to you with trust I in you have. Little we have left, we meager three, defend your ears and heart will these, take them all free from me. Clarity of mind will need thee, as the songs are magical and will compel ... then all but ye strongest enemies will be. Potions I have, guard against songs they yet might ... if potions you want?~

@8    = ~Bag of Red I sense with you! Toils and troubles you have seen, a gift from we three to bestow upon thee. Two there were but lost one did I, to Chaos I assume ... but seek each other they will. Sense to you it will make, as time and troubles pass. For now we trade our gifts to one another~
