## Introduction

This is an old mod for BG:EE, originally written by Corsymyr and published
on the Beamdog forum back in 2013.  The mod has never been updated and Corsymyr
hasn't been seen online since 2019, I was unable to find a way to contact them.
If anyone knows this person and has a way to contact them, please let me know.

Since several people were asking about this mod on the Gibberlings Three- and
Infinity Engine Discords, I created this bug-fixed version of the mod as a
small service to the modding community.  I do not intend to claim this mod as
my own work and should the original author return and demand that I remove
this, I I will do so.


Corsymyr's original description:
This is my first Mod that contains dialog files, a store, and a quest. The
battle is pretty rough, and I would suggest a party of 6 level 5 or better -
depending on your ability. The quest starts at the Friendly Arm Inn (just to
the left after entering the drawbridge). There will be 3 monks, the one in red
has a story to tell you. If you take his quest and then complete it; when you
return he will give you a unique leveling relic (with a future quest tied to
it). Once completing the quest he will also open up a Store from Kara-Tur. I
couldn't figure out 2 pieces of the Dialog, so I will list them now;
< CHARNAME > is supposed to list your character name (it did not work for me).
The second being creating/updating/deleting Journal Entries, so I gave you
items instead that have reminders of what you are to be doing ... they serve
as well as tips to the huge easter egg the quest itself is. If you enjoy
playing a Monk there are some very nice items to help you through your early
life (don't forget your Wisdom).

The store has a mix of about 30+ new items (around 7 or so new types). The
relic is something you'll have to figure out how to work, but it has 4 levels
of power. All in all it shouldn't be too over the top, the highest items in the
store are +2 and there are only 3 if I remember correctly.
